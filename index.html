                <h2>Hi, I'm Marieta</h2>
                <p>I create <strong>modern primitive cross stitch patterns</strong> inspired by nature, folklore, and the simple beauty of handmade things. Each design is hand-drawn with love and attention to detail.</p>
                <p>My patterns have a <strong>rustic, vintage charm</strong> - muted colors and designs that look like cherished heirlooms. I hand-dye my own linen using tea, flowers, and herbs for that perfectly aged look.</p>
                <p>When I'm not designing, I'm building <strong>free tools</strong> to help fellow stitchers organize their stashes and plan their projects.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>For beginners, 14-count Aida is recommended as it has visible holes and is easy to work with. Intermediate stitchers often prefer 16-18 count for finer detail. Advanced stitchers use 28-32 count linen or evenweave, stitching over two threads. Use our free <a href="fabric-calculator.html">Fabric Calculator</a> to determine the exact fabric size needed for your pattern.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Primitive cross stitch is a style that creates an aged, antique look using hand-dyed fabrics (like tea-dyed linen), muted color palettes, and designs inspired by early American samplers and folk art. Patterns often feature nature motifs, simple borders, and rustic charm that resembles cherished family heirlooms. All Needle Treasures Nook patterns are designed in this modern primitive style.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>DMC and Anchor are commercial 6-strand cotton embroidery floss with consistent colors between batches - they're interchangeable using our <a href="dmc-anchor-conversion.html">conversion tool</a>. Hand-dyed threads (like Classic Colorworks, Gentle Art, and Weeks Dye Works) are dyed in small batches with natural color variations, creating a more organic, aged appearance perfect for primitive and sampler designs.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Use our <a href="fabric-calculator.html">Fabric Calculator</a>: enter the pattern's stitch count (width x height), select your fabric count (e.g., 14ct Aida, 32ct linen over 2), and add your desired margin (typically 3-4 inches per side for framing). The calculator instantly shows the fabric size needed in both inches and centimeters.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">What does "over 2" mean in cross stitch?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>"Over 2" means stitching over two fabric threads instead of one. This is common with high-count linens and evenweaves (28ct, 32ct, 36ct). For example, 32-count linen stitched over 2 threads gives the same stitch size as 16-count Aida. Our Fabric Calculator automatically accounts for this when you select "over 2" options.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">What is Aida fabric vs linen for cross stitch?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p><strong>Aida</strong> is a woven fabric with obvious holes in a grid pattern - perfect for beginners. It comes in counts like 14, 16, and 18. <strong>Linen</strong> is a natural fiber with a softer, more organic look. It comes in higher counts (28-40) and is typically stitched "over 2" threads. Linen is preferred for primitive and heirloom designs due to its texture and drape.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">How many strands of floss should I use for cross stitch?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The number of strands depends on your fabric count: <strong>14-count Aida</strong>: 2-3 strands. <strong>16-18 count</strong>: 2 strands. <strong>28-32 count over 2</strong>: 2 strands. <strong>36+ count over 2</strong>: 1-2 strands. Using fewer strands creates a flatter, more delicate look common in primitive designs. More strands give fuller coverage.</p>
